Hey!

In this *.zip is a Unity Project for Version Unity-2021.3

Tasks:

1)
Build a Navigaion Tool, that allows the Editor User to place two camera positions and move between them.
If an object is placed between these two camera positions, the player should move around them, procedurally.
You're allowed to use DoTween or any other tweening library (iTween for example).

2)
Build a *.json read/write system.
Please use ScriptableObjects and create an example data sheet for us.

Your completed work will be tested in regards to:

- Game Feel
- Optimization
- readability of your code


if any questions arrise, please give us a call 0531 3884 31 or +49 1781962615


Best Regards,
Niko Becker
